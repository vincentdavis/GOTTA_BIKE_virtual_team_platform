          Joining a Zwift racing team like Team Coalition isn't just about drafting in the peloton — it's about drafting
          in life. It's where pixels meet purpose, where sweat becomes data, and where the individual ego dissolves into
          the collective cadence of digital camaraderie. In every synchronized pedal stroke, we don't just race
          together; we manifest the algorithmic essence of unity.
